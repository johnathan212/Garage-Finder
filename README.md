# Garage-Finder

Project Outline:

Must-have features(10-40 hours, more depending on long it takes me to grasp swift, database, ui builder concepts)

  Build an app comparable to craigslist or airbnb but for garages or private parking spots.
The app should utilize an online database and have the ability to read from and write to it.
Listings should be searchable by address. Images for listings should be uploadable to the
database as well. User input should be verified.

Nice-to-have features(30+ hourss to implement?)
-listings appearing on a map
-login authorization via firebase
-Nice looking UI
-user location
-Better usage of MVC architecture
